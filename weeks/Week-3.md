Interviews
===

For this week's assignment, we have been asked during our interviews to justify/refute our current vision of the DLO study case. Sadly, we have not been able to add new arguments to the existing ones we already have. Our vision believes that the DLO needs to provide certain tooling and once it does, there is no improvement or harm to the student's learning. To have a deep impact, other changes needs to be performed. However, a major usability overhaul would be greatly accepted.

From this week interviews, we can extract the following conclusions.

- Compared with other DLO's, the current system we are using is not that bad.
- Students still prefer to use their own tools, which sometimes share with other students. This means every student will always prefer their own tooling. The only exception is in case it is a requirement for the course they are taking.
