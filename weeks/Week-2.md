Interviews
===

For this week assignment, as our group increased in size, we decided to conduct more interviews. In total, we conducted 5 interviews. Four of them were to students and one of them was to the Policy Advisor Information Management at the Hogeschool Leiden. We contacted him to ask his opinion as a relevant source of information due to his unique and very different point of view of this topic.

One of the interviews was conducted using the methodology of "Apprenticing with the customer". The rest of them were done with a list of questions prepared. This has been one of the improvements from last week as we aimed to be able to answer the question "*what tools do we need to support the learning process within courses*".

We extracted some conclusions from it:

- **Students blame the poor usability, especially on mobile phones.** They miss integrations with other platforms that they use in their lives, features that other products offer by default and a much better UI.

- **We have been able to identify some of the key features that a DLO must have.** Based on the current information from the interviews and our research, a DLO must have at least the following features: notification system, storage for course materials, course structure and the possibility to upload new content.

- **Many existing features are not being used due to lack of training**. Professors and students are not using it the right way due to a huge variety of backgrounds and technical knowledge.
