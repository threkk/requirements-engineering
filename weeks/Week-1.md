# Interviews

The first assignment of the course has been to interview different students about their opinion about the current *Blackboard* used in the university.  The main objective of the interviews was to find which is the general opinion about the system and also to make us getting started with interviewing as data acquisition methodology.

We interviewed three different students from three different majors who have been using *Blackboard* for a certain period of time. The answers we received were quite uniform and all of them agreed in most of the main ideas:

- **The interviewees were satisfied with the features that the *Blackboard* offers to them.** All of them make intensive daily use of the *Blackboard* and value features like having a place where all the information is available and the option to get notified when new material is added.

- **Their main complaint is that the quality depends entirely on the professor who is in charge of the system.** Some of them have a well-organised space full of content which provides a good user experience but for many of them is just a place to drop files, leading to a bad experience for the students.

- **Most of the interviewees' suggestions besides a better training for the professors were towards the usability**: fixing bugs with existing features like tests, improving the usability on mobile devices (including promoting the native applications) and including features like a search option.
